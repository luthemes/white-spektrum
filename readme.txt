Installation
================================================================================================
1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's ZIP file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

Customizer
================================================================================================
1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Customize
2. List of different types that you can modify such as
   - Site Title Tagline
      - Hide Display Header Text (this will hide the entire header with header text)
3. Mobile Menu
   - The Mobile Menu is slightly different from other themes. I have created a mobile menu that is
     at the bottom left corner that helps users to navigation easier. The reason why is that 90% of
     users when using their device, their hands are always at the bottom of the screen which kind of
     makes the mobile menu more sense to have it at the bottom left corner. The Menu itself when is not
     set, the Site Title and Tagline will move to the center, if set, the Site Title and Tagline will move
     to the left while the menu is at the right side.
4. Header Image
   - Add Header Image
   - Remove Header Image (When removing a header image, the default image will display).
5. Layouts Supports
   - Post Layouts
   - Page layouts
   - Custom Layouts
   - Archive Layouts
   The Layout Supports gives the user the ability to change their layouts if they choose to do so.
6. Static Front Page
   - Front Page
   - Blog

Custom Background, Custom Header is now available so that you can choose more features for this theme. 
This theme also supports new features that allows you to choose different layouts from blog layout, page 
layout and custom layout if you choose to use sidebars or no sidebars.


Frequently Asked Questions
================================================================================================
Why does the theme look slightly different form the original?
As a developer, will need to keep up with the standard practice throughout the years active on 
WordPress.org. I didn't know much about coding or standard when I started, but throughout the years,
I have improved my understanding so that I can make this theme better.
